## Introduction
<p>Machine learning applications in cancer prognosis and prediction is a constantly evolving trend. As machine learning techniques are getting better, many scientists are predicting that the machine learning is the future of cancer prediction.</p>

<p>As per this <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1748301818756225" >Scientific Journal</a>, breast cancer is the second most leading cancer in women compared to all other cancers. </p>

<p>In order to support the research and prepare future machine learning scientists, [Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer) has made the breast cancer data publicly available for research and scientific studies.</p>

## Problem Identification and Data Features Description

The human body has about 100 trillion cells and usually those cells behave in a certain way. However, occasionally, one of these 100 trillion cells, behave in a different way and keeps dividing and pushing other cells around it out of the way. That cell stops observing the rules of the tissue within which it is located and begins to move out of its normal position and starts invading into the tissues around it and sometimes entering the bloodstream and becoming is called a metastasis.

In summary, as we grow older,throughout a lifetime, we go through this knid of situation where a particular kind of gene is mutated where the protein that it makes is abnormal and drives the cell to behave in a different way that we call cancer. This is what Dr. WIlliam H. Wolberg was observing, who put together this dataset.

**Attribute Information:**
