As per WildFoodUK (https://www.wildfooduk.com/articles/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-poisonous-and-edible-mushrooms/), it is extremely difficult to find the differences between edible and poisonous mushrooms. The general rule is that if you see other animals eating a mushroom, then that should be safe for humans. The best way is to identify the mushroom type as that would help in deciding if it is safe or not. You can check out for the following features to help identify a mushroom:

- The texture of the mushroom
- Size, shape and colour of the cap
- Smell
- Where is the mushroom growing?

There is a nice document listing a variety of edible mushrooms we found and we are sharing it for your benefit:
